# Banking System Backend

Welcome to the backend of our Banking System project. This README provides an overview of the backend's structure, setup instructions, and important details for developers who want to work on or understand this part of the system.

## Technologies Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Web application framework for Node.js
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/): Real-time database platform for PostgreSQL
- Other dependencies (see package.json for details)

## Project Structure

The backend codebase is organized into several directories:

- `config`: Contains configuration files, such as the Supabase client setup.
- `controllers`: Contains controller functions responsible for handling API routes.
- `middleware`: Contains custom middleware functions, including authentication middleware.
- `routes`: Defines API routes and their associated controllers.
- `app.js`: Initializes the Express application, sets up middleware, and defines API routes.
- `server.js`: Starts the Express server and connects to the Supabase project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the backend locally:

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following environment variables:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL=your-supabase-project-url
SUPABASE_API_KEY=your-supabase-api-key
```

Replace `your-supabase-project-url` and `your-supabase-api-key` with your actual Supabase project credentials.

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Server

Start the server using:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will run on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is 3000).

## API Routes

The API routes are defined in the `routes` directory. The backend currently includes routes for user registration, login, and user profile. You can extend these routes for additional features.

## Middleware

Custom middleware functions can be found in the `middleware` directory. They are used for handling authentication and other common tasks.

## Controllers

The `controllers` directory contains functions that handle specific API routes. For example, the `authController` handles user registration and login.

## Supabase Configuration

The Supabase client is configured in the `config/supabaseConfig.js` file. Ensure that your Supabase project URL and API key are correctly set here.

## Authentication and Authorization

The backend includes basic authentication functionality using Supabase. You can enhance this by implementing features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Advanced Features

To make this banking system more advanced, consider implementing additional features, as mentioned in the project's [advanced features](#advanced-features) section. These features can enhance security, user experience, and functionality.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Be sure to follow the project's coding and contribution guidelines.

Please feel free to update and customize this README to fit the specific details of your banking system project. It serves as an important document for anyone working with your backend code.
